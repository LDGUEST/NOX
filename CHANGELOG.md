## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`/nox:start`** — guided onboarding skill: detects project stack, asks one question about workflow focus, recommends 5-8 skills in priority order with quick wins and hook suggestions
- **Registry system** — 7 niche skills moved to `registry/` directory (install with `--with-registry`): api, schema, landing, doc, swot, monitorlive, explain, env
- **`--with-registry` install flag** — opt-in extended/niche skill installation
- **Skill test suite** (`tests/test-skills.sh`) — 28 tests covering skill existence, agent validation, CLI parity, MCP version, merge content verification, edge cases
- **Troubleshooting section** in README — 6 common issues with solutions
- **Uninstall instructions** in README

### Changed
- **Skill pruning: 41 → 30 core + 8 registry** — reduced cognitive load for new users while preserving all functionality
- **4 skill merges** (absorbed into stronger hosts):
  - `overwrite` → `context-engineer` (new `--reset <component>` action)
  - `a11y` → `uxtest` (expanded Phase 4 with full WCAG 2.1 AA audit — 8 sub-categories)
  - `unloop` → `iterate` (new `--unattended` mode with zero-regression mandate, micro-iteration protocol, anti-hanging rules, hook safety net)
  - `push` → `deploy` (platform auto-detection for 6 platforms, push-first strategy, retry logic)
- **`iterate` skill expanded** — from 44 lines to full autonomous execution guide with decomposition, verification criteria, self-correction protocol, unattended repair mode, and completion report format
- **`deploy` skill expanded** — now covers push + deploy workflow with platform detection and retry logic
- **`uxtest` skill expanded** — Phase 4 now has 8 WCAG audit sub-categories (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav, images, forms, color/contrast, motion)
- **MCP server version** — 1.5.0 → 2.5.0 (synced with release)
- **`uninstall.sh` updated** — added JS hooks cleanup, added missing hooks to removal list, updated Codex skill list
- **`guardrails.md`** — updated autonomous mode reference from "iterate, unloop" to "iterate, iterate --unattended"
- **`skill-create.md`** — updated dangerous skill examples to reflect current skill set
- **`agent-tracker.sh`** — updated help message to reference `/nox:iterate` only
- Updated `help-forge` skill catalog to 30 core + 8 registry
- Updated README: badges, catalog, structure diagram, install instructions, all counts
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: version, counts, structure, test suite references
- Updated `gemini-extension.json`: version 3.0.0

### Removed
- **4 standalone skills** (absorbed into other skills, not deleted):
  - `/nox:overwrite` — now `/nox:context-engineer --reset`
  - `/nox:a11y` — now part of `/nox:uxtest` Phase 4
  - `/nox:unloop` — now `/nox:iterate --unattended`
  - `/nox:push` — now part of `/nox:deploy`

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **6 new skills** across all 3 CLIs (Claude, Gemini, Codex):
  - `/nox:doc` — generate documentation from code (JSDoc, docstrings, README sections)
  - `/nox:api` — design and scaffold REST/GraphQL API endpoints from a spec
  - `/nox:schema` — database schema designer (ER diagrams, migration planning, normalization)
  - `/nox:env` — environment variable auditor (missing vars, secrets in code, `.env.example` generation)
  - `/nox:explain` — onboarding guide generator (architecture mapping, data flow, "start here" pointers)
  - `/nox:a11y` — accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA, ARIA, keyboard nav, color contrast)
- **Hook health dashboard** — `nox-metrics.sh health` validates hook files exist, are executable, checks settings.json references match actual files, reports broken hooks
- **SQLite fallback to JSONL** — `session-cost-tracker.sh` falls back to `.nox_metrics.jsonl` when sqlite3 is unavailable (Windows Git Bash)
- **JSONL metrics queries** — `nox-metrics.sh` supports `summary` and `recent` subcommands via grep/awk when sqlite3 is missing
- **Smoke test suite** (`tests/test-smoke.sh`) — validates skill parity across CLIs, frontmatter integrity, hook file presence, lib-json sourcing
- Skill count: 35 → 41

### Changed
- **Smart hook routing** — added early-exit fast paths to 6 hooks (todo-tracker, drift-detector, debug-reminder, build-tracker, test-regression-guard, secret-scanner) reducing wasted JSON parsing on irrelevant events
- Updated `help-forge` skill catalog to include all 41 skills
- Updated README badges, skill catalog, and structure diagram for v2.5

### Fixed
- Removed phantom `branch-protect.sh` reference from settings.json hook config (file never existed, caused PreToolUse:Bash errors on every Bash tool call)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Skills v2 frontmatter** across all 35 Claude skills:
  - `disable-model-invocation: true` on 17 skills with side effects (commit, deploy, push, iterate, etc.)
  - `argument-hint` on 24 skills for autocomplete UX
  - `user-invocable: false` on guardrails (background knowledge, not a command)
- **Subagent isolation** (`context: fork`) on 12 heavy skills — scan, audit, security, review, perf, swot, uxtest, iterate, full-phase, prompt, context-engineer, monitorlive now run in isolated context windows
- **Session cost tracker** — per-session token/cost metrics to SQLite DB for A/B comparison (hooks ON vs OFF). Includes duration, commits, efficiency metrics, per-machine breakdown
- **`lib-json.sh`** — shared lightweight JSON extraction library using `grep -oE` (POSIX ERE). ~50x faster than python3 for single-field extraction (~2ms vs ~30-80ms)
- **`NOX_SKIP_ALL` master toggle** — disable all hooks at once for A/B testing while keeping cost tracker running
- **CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — validate.sh, shellcheck, node --check
- **Hook integration tests** (`tests/test-hooks.sh`) — 18 tests covering destructive-guard, commit-lint, secret-scanner, file-size-guard, context-monitor
- **Install tests** (`tests/test-install.sh`) — 27 tests for all install modes
- **Content parity validation** in validate.sh — strips frontmatter, md5sums body, compares across 3 CLI formats
- **Log rotation** — session log capped at 500 entries, metrics DB capped at 1000 sessions
- **Recovery playbook system** — zero-intervention context handoff across compactions
- **Colored statusline** hooks with session cost display
- **`/nox:swot`** — SWOT analysis skill added to Gemini and Codex (was Claude-only)
- **Skills reference doc** (`.planning/claude-skills-reference.md`) — 1000+ line comprehensive reference covering Agent Skills spec, Claude extensions, best practices, evals

### Changed
- **Hook hot paths rewritten** — eliminated python3 from 15 hooks, replaced with `lib-json.sh` grep-based extraction
- **`nox-parse.sh` consolidated** as thin wrapper around `lib-json.sh` (was duplicate implementation)
- **Hash-based dedup** in secret-scanner — md5 caches prevent re-scanning unchanged files
- **Counter-before-stdin pattern** in cost-alert — skips 19/20 calls without any JSON parsing
- **Description optimization** — overwrite and full-phase descriptions rewritten with natural trigger keywords
- **35/35 content parity** — all skill body content synced across Claude, Gemini, and Codex
- Skill count: 34 → 35

### Fixed
- **Stop hook crash** (persistent "No stderr output") — two root causes:
  1. `lib-json.sh` grep returning exit 1 under `set -e` — fixed with `{ ...; } 2>/dev/null || true`
  2. `session-cost-tracker.sh` calling `sqlite3` on Windows where it doesn't exist (exit 127) — fixed with `command -v sqlite3` guard
- **`grep -oP` incompatibility** on Git Bash/MSYS — all hooks now use `-oE` (POSIX ERE)
- **CRLF line endings** from Windows agents breaking bash scripts

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **YAML frontmatter** on all 34 Claude skills and 23 Codex skills — skills can now auto-invoke from natural language, not just explicit `/nox:name`
- **`/nox:scan`** — new meta-skill that auto-detects project type and dispatches up to 4 parallel agents (reviewer, security, dep-auditor, context-engineer)
- **`/nox:context-engineer` diagnostics** — Phase 2 now runs 11 structural + security checks: circular imports, missing references, large files, deep chains, duplicate imports, exposed secrets
- **Progressive disclosure** — `context-engineer` split into `SKILL.md` + `references/DIAGNOSTICS.md` for Codex/Gemini; Claude version trimmed from 353 → 166 lines
- **Global file protection** — `armor` and `context-engineer` now explicitly prohibit writes to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, and other system files
- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** on dangerous skills: `deploy`, `push`, `unloop`, `overwrite` — prevents accidental auto-triggering
- **`compatibility` field** on tools requiring specific deps: `uxtest` (Playwright), `scan` (Agent tool), `security`, `monitorlive`, `cicd`
- **`metadata` field** (`author: nox`, `version: "1.6"`) on all 34 Claude skills
- **GitHub issue templates** — bug report, feature request, skill idea
- **Skill count corrected** — README updated from 33 → 34 skills
- **`CLAUDE.local.md`** added to context-engineer registry (flagged as deprecated)
- **`--codebase` flag** on context-engineer for codebase-level diagnostic checks

### Changed
- **Expanded skills** — architect, landing, questions each rewritten with full phase-based process (from ~20 lines to 100-150 lines each)
- **`skill-create` updated** — now teaches spec-compliant format: frontmatter on all 3 CLIs, `references/` directories, `disable-model-invocation` for dangerous ops
- **Rules sections rewritten** — replaced ALL-CAPS NEVER/ALWAYS mandates with reasoning-based rules per Anthropic skill-creator guidance
- **`update` skill** — Windows path changed from hardcoded to `%USERPROFILE%` pattern

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **MCP server** — any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can invoke Nox skills via 3 tools: `nox_list`, `nox_skill`, `nox_agent`
- **One-liner curl install** — `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LDGUEST/NOX-CLI-ADD-ONS/main/install.sh | bash` clones to `~/.nox` and installs
- MCP server auto-registers in `~/.claude/.mcp.json` during install

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- `/nox:guardrails` skill — inline safety checks that mirror all 19 Claude Code hooks for Gemini and Codex users
- Guardrails wired into 11 skills across all 3 CLIs (full-phase, quick-phase, iterate, unloop, refactor, tdd, review, audit, security, deploy, push)
